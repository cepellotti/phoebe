The installation requires:
* cmake
* gcc, version compatible with c++17
* internet connection (we will download external libraries)

To install Phoebe, type:
git submodule update --init
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)

This will create two executables:
* phoebe
* runTests (for developers)

In order to compile the documentation, you need to have installed:
* doxygen
* graphviz
Then type
* make doc

Tested with gcc v9. Note that old compilers may not support c++17.

Notes for Mac Users: 
There can be trouble linking to the libgfortran files required by scalapack. 
If libgfortran is not found, try adding it specifically to LD_LIBRARY_PATH: 
  export LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/libgfortran/
If using homebrew installed gcc, you might need to add the cellar copy rather than the 
one located with gcc:
  export LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/9.3.0_1/lib/gcc/9/)
