Phoebe is a code for the ab-initio compoutation of electron and phonon transport properties of crystals.


## Functionalities

Current capabilities include:

- Electron mobility
- Phonon thermal conductivity, limited by
- Electron and phonon viscosity
- Wigner distribution corrections to Boltzmann equation
- Density of states
- Plot of band structure dispersion.
- Powered by Quantum-ESPRESSO and Phonon3py

With more in development!
